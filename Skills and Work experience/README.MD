## Skills and Work experience

### GoLang

I have been working on GoLang for the past 1 year. GoLang is not my primary development environment and hence
my project are limited to small scale personal projects. Recently I had decided to contribute and at the same
time increase my GoLang by participating in open source projects.

Since [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf) has one of the largest collection of GoLang projects I choose to start with exploring some of its
repositories, that is when I came to know about Community Bridge and [KubeVirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt) project. 
This would be the first time I am contributing to an open source project written primarily in GoLang.

Some of my smaller GoLang projects can be found [here](./Golang).

### Kubernetes

I have used Kubernetes in many of my previous projects. Some of them include:
* ##### Deploying full automated Canary deployment of Django webapp.

I have deployed the following django application as a canary deployment on Kubernetes.
The work involved around setting up a multi-node kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud, creating deployments and services
and setting up automated rolling update.

* ##### Setting up Jenkins CI/CD pipeline on Kubernetes and Google Cloud.

I have set up a remote Jenkins server and integrated it with Kubernetes to create a CI/CD pipeline. All the work was
done from scratch and used Google Cloud to set up the clusters.

* ##### Using minikube to deploy and manage small scale single-node micro-services.
This work involved exploring minikube and deploying web-apps locally on minikube.

I have also completed a coursera course, [Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine](https://coursera.org/share/89c285cfb0bf5803fd16fec728d0980f), and I am currently pursuing the specialization for the same.

Since most of the Kubernetes clusters are available as paid service I am not able to share the code/commands. However,
feel free to open an issue in case of any questions.

### Open Source

* ##### CHAOSS
I have been involved as a contributor to [CHAOSS](https://github.com/chaoss) for the past few months. The CHAOSS community is involved with developing metrics, methodologies,
and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability.
  
My work is involved with the [GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) toolchain. Grimoirelab projects has around 15+ repositories under the CHAOSS
organization. With the tools in the GrimoireLab toolset you can retrieve data, store it in databases, analyze it, and produce nice dashboards for interactively visualizing the resulting information. 
One of these beautiful dashboards can be found here, [OpenShift/OKD community dashboard](https://openshift.biterg.io/app/kibana#/dashboard/Overview). 

The technologies and frameworks involved are Python, Shell, Docker, ElasticSearch, Kibana, GraphQL, REST APIs, Travis CI.
I have integrated new data sources to fetch the data from, enriched the fetched JSON into ElasticSearch documents, created default dashboards and wrote unit test for all the previous steps.
Additionally, I have solved numerous bugs, updated documentations, fixed CI/CD and reviewed PRs. 

* ##### Wikimedia

The [Wikimedia Commons Android app](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons) allows users to upload pictures from their Android phone/tablet to Wikimedia Commons. 
I have been involved with finding and fixing bugs in the project. The technologies and frameworks involved are Android, Java, Kotlin, Android MVP, REST APIs.

### CI/CD

I have experience with setting up and maintaining Travis CI and Jenkins. I am also good at submitting good and clean patches.
